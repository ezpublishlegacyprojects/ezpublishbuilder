Introduction
============

1. What is the eZ Publish Builder?
----------------------------------

A set of php files and tools to "build" eZ Publish Community Projects tarballs and deliverables.
It is based on the Pake tool.

The build process consists of the following steps:
- getting a copy of the latest version of the source code from the git repository
- replacing some token strings inside some specific files (eg. version nr. and licensing info)
- other stuff... (black magic)
- creating tarballs in different formats

The current state of evolution is:
the tool can only be used to generate MS WPI packages from an already built eZP source tree

2. License
----------

This software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.0 . The
complete license agreement is included in the LICENSE file. For more information
or questions please contact info@ez.no

3. Requirements
---------------

- the php cli
- Pake version 1.6.1 or later.
  You can get it either from https://github.com/indeyets/pake/wiki
  or as part of the extension itself, the first time you run the pakefile.php script
- the Zeta Components php library (only for generating tarballs and html docs from rst)
- command line tools: git

4. Installing
-------------

Read the INSTALL file to get started and for usage instructions


Directory structure
===================

Let's call ROOT_DIR the directory where you will be running the build script.::

ROOT_DIR/
 |___pakefile.php this is the script driving the build
 |
 |___build        a copy of the eZ sources will be downloaded here during the build
 |
 |___dist/        tarballs produced by the build will be made available here
 |
 `___pake/
     |___doc/     more documentation, such as changelogs, todos and known bugs
     |___src/     a complete copy of the pake tool
     |___README   this file
     |___INSTALL  installation instructions
     |___LICENSE  license file
     `___...      template files used so far to the generate the wpi package

As you can see, we try to pollute as little as possible the ROOT_DIR: everything
is neatly stowed away in the pake, build and dist subdirectories.


FAQ
===

- Can a standalone copy of pake be used with the pakefile instead of the bundled one?
    Yes: just use a different command line: ::
    php pake.php build ...

- Can I download a complete zip of the tool instead of doing the bootstrap?
    Yes. Come back later for a list of urls to use ;-)
